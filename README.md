How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The best way to interpret user needs is to coordinate with your Product Owner, or, if you don't have one, talk directly with the customer about what they are trying to achieve with their product. Then you are able to create user stories which communicate to the rest of the team what the client needs from the product and also includes acceptance criteria. It shows the team the clients perspective and the experience they want the end user to have, making development more clear.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I start off by creating psuedocode because that allows me to see the requirements of the program first without having to worry about how I will code it yet. I then think about the end user experience that is desired and start coding from there. I hope to incorporate user stories, and creating my own sprint lengths in the future that way I have a timeline to shooot for.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development means having clear, transparent communication within the team. Knowing when to ask others for help or requesting clarification when needed, and being a good team player. I also think going above and beyond your designated role is crucial, i.e. helping the development team catch bugs if you're a tester before they even happen.
